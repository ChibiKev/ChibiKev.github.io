                A responsive full-stack web application where resident staff can post about upcoming events for students that dorm at CCNY Towers using React, Node + Express, and PostgreSQL.
              </p>
              <p>
                Resident CCNY was created for a hackathon where the challenge was to develop an improvement that can be made to the Towers and pitch how it can be implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem that we found about the Towers were that their bulletin boards for events were crowded and disorganized, 
                and that they needed a more efficient and effective way to market events. 
                They also have a low retention rate for their community so something needs to be done to get their community more involved.
                With that being said, the motivation for Resident CCNY came from wanting to improve the experience of its residents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Resident CCNY is an information web application, that provided access to hangouts and local events, and a community forum.
                This would help the Towers residents find things to do with peers within The Towers community.
                The community forum would help start up conversations and allow for anonymous posting about concerns the community have about. 
                This would all be moderated by the Towers staff to prevent trolls or cyberbullying.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, Resident CCNY won first place for The Towers Hackathon.
