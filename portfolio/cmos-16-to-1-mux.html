                Designed a CMOS of a 16-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX) using Electric.
              </p>
              <p>
                A 16-to-1 Multiplexer is a form of digital circuit that is used to select a certain data. 
                The 16-to-1 Multiplexer would have a total of 20 inputs and one output. 
                16 of the inputs are data, and the other 4 are what's used to select those data. 
                The output would be the one of the 16 inputs, depending on what the selector selects. 
                Multiplexers itself are often used in larger circuitry and helps a lot in terms of which 
                data are being selected so it could be used for modification without modifying the other data.
              </p>
              <p>
                To design a conventional 16-to-1 Multiplexer we would need to use three different designs and combine them together. 
                The three designs that we plan to use would be a three input AND gate, a four input OR gate, and an inverter. 
                The reason for this approach is because we can't directly build a conventional 16-to-1 Multiplexer without first 
                building a 4-to-1 Multiplexer or any Multiplexer, and we can't build a Multiplexer without using an AND gate, OR gate, or an inverter. 
                By applying four AND gates, one OR gate, and two inverters, we'll be able to obtain a 4-to-1 Multiplexer. 
                After making the 4-to-1 Multiplexer, we create 4 more 4-to-1 Multiplexer and link them together to create a 16-to-1 Multiplexer. 
                The figures on the next few pages show the schematic and layout of the two input AND gate, which becomes a three input AND gate, two input OR gate, 
                which becomes a four input OR gate, an inverter, and a 4-to-1 Multiplexer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The approach we plan to take to design the transmission gate 16-to-1 Multiplexer would be to use two different designs and combining them together. 
                The two designs that we plan to use would be a transmission gate, and an inverter. 
                The reason for this approach is because we can't directly build a transmission gate 16-to-1 Multiplexer 
                without first building a 4-to-1 Multiplexer or any Multiplexer, and we can't build a Multiplexer without using a transmission gate, or an inverter. 
                By applying six transmission gates, and two inverters, we'll be able to obtain a 4-to-1 Multiplexer. 
                After making the 4-to-1 Multiplexer, we create 4 more 4-to-1 Multiplexer and link them together to create a 16-to-1 Multiplexer.
