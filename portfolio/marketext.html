              <p>
                A responsive full-stack web application to create a platform for students to buy, sell, trade or swap their textbooks using React, Flask, and MySQL.
              </p>
              <p>
                Marketext is a web application where users can buy, sell, trade, and swap school textbooks. 
                Users are able to look for textbooks in each specific category that they are interested in. 
                Users then decide on the agreement that they want, though it is possible to negotiate or adjust the offers posted through messaging the owner. 
                The four main features are described as follows:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Buy: Users are able to make postings for a textbook that they wish to sell, 
                    and can include the price that they are looking to sell it for as well as the condition that the textbook is in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sell: Users are able to search for textbooks that they may be looking to purchase, browsing through listings according to price, condition, edition, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Trade: Users are able to trade a textbook they own for another specific textbook they are looking for. 
                    The owner lists the textbooks that they are willing to trade it for, with value not playing a factor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Swap: Users are able to swap a textbook that they already own for something else, with more flexibility on what they are looking for. 
                    Users are not looking for anything specific; instead, they are open to offers, and value does play a factor.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
